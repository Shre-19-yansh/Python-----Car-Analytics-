# 🚗 Cars Dataset Analysis — Data Analytics Case Study


## 📌 Introduction

The Cars Dataset Analysis project explores how features like horsepower, cylinders, and type influence car pricing and performance across manufacturers using the cars.csv dataset. It examines relationships among key attributes such as MSRP, Make, and Type.

Through data cleaning, EDA, and visualizations, the study reveals which manufacturers produce more sports or hybrid cars, how horsepower impacts MSRP, and which features correlate most with price. Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly Express, and WordCloud are used for analysis and insights.

# 📂 Files in the Repository

- README.md – project overview and documentation

- Cars.csv - Contains data on cars, make, and other attributes about car.

- Case_Study_Solution – Notebook containing code, EDA, and visualizations along with analysis

# 🎯 What I  Did:

- Downloaded the dataset from a reliable source.

- Imported the data along the necessary libraries numpy, pandas and matplotlib

- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data structure and relationships.

- Created visualizations to answer analytical questions and uncover key insights.

# 🚀 Steps in the Project
1.	Read Dataset – Imported cars.csv into Python using Pandas.
2.	Imported Libraries – Imported libraries like Pandas and matplotlib
3.	Perform EDA – Explored data patterns and trends among car features.
4.	Visualize Relationships – Created bar graphs, scatterplots, and wordclouds.
5.	Insights – Summarized key findings about factors affecting car prices and manufacturer patterns
